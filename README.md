### :warning: **LIMITATIONS**  


:arrow_forward: **No Cloud Sync** â€“ Tasks are saved locally, meaning they wonâ€™t sync across devices.  

:arrow_forward: **No Due Date or Priority Sorting** â€“ Tasks are displayed in the order they are added without priority levels.  

:arrow_forward: **No Multiple User Support** â€“ The app doesnâ€™t support multiple users or accounts.  

:arrow_forward: **Limited Styling** â€“ Tkinter provides basic UI styling; more advanced designs require additional libraries.
